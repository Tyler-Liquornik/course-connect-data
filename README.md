## What I Learned

Ultimately, I chose never to pursue the data analysis project to analyze pathways between courses and jobs.
I identified after speaking to Western's students across programs and disciplines over the course of the weeks after this project that the problem I aimed to solve is not as I had imagined.
I wanted to help students with course selection and course load management, thinking that all students struggle with this because engineering students like myself typically do which is a bad assumption.
I learned later from speaking to these people that a lot of them actually have a good hold of this type stuff and their faculty helps manage it better than the engineering faculty does.
This would shrink the market for this product down immediately to mainly just engineers, and mostly remove the need to scrape courses.
I did learn about Python and Selenium though, and always enjoy making MVPs for software projects so this 2-3 week ideating and building experience was well worth it still.
